                <section class>
                    <p> Below we can see an easy-to-understand table showcasing the requisites set forth by the hybrid cybersecurity framework to ensure a quality level of cybersecurity hygiene. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p> This framework was developed with the intent of being used by specifically by football clubs and other sporting organisations alike, and developed to be easily understood by someone who does not have a background in Information Technology. Combining 4 already existing cybersecurity frameworks, this tool is incredibly valuable to any of the relevant parties when formulating a robust cybersecurity strategy.</p>
                    <br>
