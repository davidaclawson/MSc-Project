                <section class>
                    <p> Throughout the development of this project, a variety of key and useful sources were used to expand the researchers knowledge base, and provide evidence to support the argument being made by the researcher. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p> Firstly, it is important to acknowledge the already existing cybersecurity frameworks that were utilised to create the newly developed hybrid cybersecurity framework used throughout this project. They can be found here, please click on the below links to access more information: 
                        <ul style="list-style: none;">
                            <li><a href="https://securiti.ai/blog/understanding-fifa-2022-world-cup-cybersecurity-framework/"> Securiti Qatar 2022 Fifa World Cup Cybersecurity Framework </a></li>
                            <li><a href="https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework"> NIST Cybersecurity Framework </a></li>
                            <li><a href="https://www.cisecurity.org/controls"> CIS Controls Framework </a></li>
                            <li><a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/cyberessentials/overview"> NCSC Cyber Essentials Framework </a></li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p> Next, a variety of books, websites, and journal articles were also used throughout the formation of this project. These references were incredibly important in helping the researcher to understand the current standard of cybersecurity practices within the world of football and sport, as well as a general understanding of cybersecurity practices as a whole. These references can be found by clicking on the following webpage: <a href="https://pastebin.com/deh7SDFG"> David Lawson MSc Project: References</a>.     
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p> All of these references were key in expanding the researchers knowledge and skills that were developed throughout the rest of the MSc Information Technology with Cyber Security course. Without them, this research project would not have been possible.</p>
