                    <h3> Key Information </h3>
                    <p> The website created here has been developed as part of the research project delivered by David Lawson (1508178) as a requirement of completion towards the MSc Information Technology with Cyber Security course. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p> The rationale behind this research project was to create a Cybersecurity Framework consisting of the best aspects of already exisitng Cybersecurity Frameworks, and developing it with the idea of it being used by football clubs, and potentially other sporting organisations alike. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p> The hyperlinks located in the navigation panels in the header and footer will direct the user to key information involved in this research project.  </p>
                    <br>
                    <p> The information presented here includes, but is not limited to, the following: 
                            <ul style="list-style: none;">

                                <li> Newly developed Hybrid Cybersecurity Framework </li>
                                <li> Key Sources and Tools </li>
                            </ul> </p>
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    <p> Firstly, special thanks to my friends and family for their support throughout the development of this research project, as well as my work colleagues in the Widening Access department at Robert Gordon University. Second, a massive thank you to the case studies who agreed to participate in this research project: their responses were invaluable in the creation of the final product. Finally, a final thank you to Dr David Lonie for his continued support in the development of this project, and keeping me on the right track throughout. </p>
